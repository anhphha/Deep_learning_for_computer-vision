# Deep_learning_for_computer-vision

Arcada UAS | Tools: Python, OpenCV, Mxnet, SqueezeNet, MobileNet |  Project is about machine deep learning to distinguish the images of dog and cat
- Preprocessed data (ETL) and examine data quality before analytics
- Labelled, trained, tested, split and fitted data for a deep (unsupervised) learning 
- Predicted the images from deep learning application
- Compared the difference between SqueezeNet and MobileNet
